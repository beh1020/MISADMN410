	  <h3>About Durham House of Pets</h3>
	  <p> <img src="DohertyFamily.jpeg" alt="Doherty Family" class="family" style="float:right;width:320px;height:200px">
		Durham House of Pets was founded in 2012 by Kathleen Doherty.  Kathleen's two kids, 
		Emily and Patrick, always brought home animals that they found as kids: cats that wandered into the yard, frogs
		they saw hopping on the sidewalk on their way home from school, even their neighbor's dog for an afternoon.
		Kathleen's friends always called the Doherty house the "Durham House of Stray Pets".<br/><br/><br/> She was walking with 
		friends in downtown Portsmouth when she overheard a couple talking about all the things they would need 
		to buy if they were going to adopt a dog or cat from the local shelter. After giving it some thought, 
		Kathleen realized there weren't any pet stores nearby to pick up supplies for pets, even she had to drive
		all over to pick up supplies for the stray animals in her house.
		Inspired by this idea, and backed with a business degree from the Whittemore School of Business and 
		Economics (2006), she em"bark"ed on the venture to open up Durham House of Pets. </p><br/>

		Durham House of Pets officially opened its doors on Saturday, May 11, 2013 at their 15 Main St location in Durham, NH.
		The store features high-end cat and dog accessories, top-rated food and treat brands, snake and fish tanks,
		and much, much more. Kathleen and her team have also connected with local pet specialty stores and now sell
		homemade, artisan dog treats.<br/><br/>
	  	In 2014, Durham House of Pets was named the best new store in the New Hampshire Seacoast region. Kathleen and
		the Durham House of Pets team has continued to expand its horizons by opening a new location in 2016 
		in Portsmouth, NH and has plans to set up another one in Kittery, ME in the next few years. 
		Durham House of Pets thanks all of its loyal customers and supporters for helping it grow over these past 
		five years and we can't wait to see what the next five will bring! </p><br/><br/>
